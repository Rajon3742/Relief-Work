        <p>Thousands of children like Emma have been affected due to school closures in Sylhet and Sunamganj. More than 30 UNICEF-assisted education centers in Sunamganj have been damaged.

        <h3>Food for a family</h3>
        <p>Crisis of food and clean water in flood prone areas. It is the responsibility of all of us to stand by the flood victims. But there is very little relief. The district administration should allocate less money to the upper class people. What is really needed is a permanent solution to the food problems.</p>
